## Project File Structure

-   Files should consist of the following, **in order**:
    1. JSDoc with @fileoverview
    2. Imports, if present
    3. The file’s implementation
-   **Exactly one blank line** separates each section that is present.
-   `@fileoverview` JSDoc should provide a **CONCISE** description of the file's content, its uses, or information about its dependencies **WHERE APPROPRIATE**. **Don't** start with "This file contains" as its obvious its a file overview from the tag. Wrapped lines are not indented. **Don't** have a salesperson's tone, it's for developers not consumers.
    Example:
    ```
    /**
     * @fileoverview Description of file. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
     * adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt.
     */
    ```

### Import Formatting Policy

-   When importing multiple named exports from a module, place the opening brace `{` on the same line as `import` and the closing brace `}` on the same line as the last imported item.
-   Keep all imports within the brace on a single line if they fit within the project’s preferred line length limit.
-   Only wrap to a new line if the imports exceed that limit, but still keep opening and closing braces on the same line as code.

Example:
✅ Preferred
```typescript
import { Box, Card, CardActions, CardContent, CardHeader, Grid, IconButton, Stack, TextField, Typography, Button } from '@mui/material';
```
❌ Avoid
```typescript
import {
  Box,
  Card,
  CardActions,
  CardContent,
  CardHeader,
  Grid,
  IconButton,
  Stack,
  TextField,
  Typography,
  Button,
} from '@mui/material';
```
