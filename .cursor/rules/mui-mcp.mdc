## LLM policy for using MUI MCP (mui-mcp) during MUI-related code work

- Ensure `mui-mcp` shows Connected in Cursor → Settings → MCP. If not, ask user to connect; do not proceed.
- Before finalizing any answer that touches MUI APIs, props, theming, styling, or migrations, fetch the latest official docs to validate details.
- Call tool: `mui-mcp.fetchDocs` with args `{ "urls": [ ... ] }` (absolute https URLs, max 3).
- Prefer canonical URLs:
    - Component: `https://mui.com/material-ui/react-<component>/`
    - API: `https://mui.com/material-ui/api/<component>/`
- Example: `{ "urls": ["https://mui.com/material-ui/react-text-field/", "https://mui.com/material-ui/api/text-field/"] }`
- Version awareness:
    - Detect installed MUI version from `package.json` (e.g.,`@mui/material`).
    - If docs show features gated by version (e.g., “Starting from v6.4.0”), ensure suggestions match the project’s installed major/minor. Offer an alternative if there’s a mismatch.
